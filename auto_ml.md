# Overview of Cloud AutoML

Supervised machine learning models follow a consistent life cycle. Supervised learning is dependent on historical data. Based on the historical data, the model is trained. Model training is simply building a hypothesis function that is capable of predicting output or dependent variables based on the input or independent variables.

For example, in the case of a sales forecasting model for a retail store, historical sales data is used for training. The data can be horizontally spread across a large number of factors that impact sales. The training data is randomly split into a training dataset and evaluation dataset. Typically, there is an 80-20 split between training and evaluation data respectively.
