# Understanding the processing options 

Apart from the IaaS option, which you can use for building your own AI and ML pipeline using compute options, Google provides a few managed services that can be used to process your data and build AI and ML pipelines. The following are the fully managed processing options:

- BigQuery
- Dataproc
- Cloud Dataflow

All the managed processing options are integrated with other Google Cloud Services such as networking, identity and access management, Stackdriver, and so on. These make it easy to track activities and tighten security for applications.

BigQuery can be used for offloading the existing data warehouse and creating a new one, and with the BigQuery ML options you can build an ML pipeline.

Dataproc can be used for migrating an existing Hadoop project on GCP and running AI and ML pipelines over it. Cloud Dataflow can be used for building completely new pipelines on GCP.
