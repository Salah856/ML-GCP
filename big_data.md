# Building a Big Data Cloud Machine Learning Engine

Machine learning (ML) has revolutionized technology realms through the implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI). In the fields of customer support, fraud detection, and business intelligence, ML have continuously become the favorites of enterprises.

The importance of ML is influencing the cloud computing sector as well. Therefore, every cloud provider, including Google, is playing a large role in revolutionizing AI services on their platforms.

They have invested heavily in the past years, from the development of new services through major reorganizations that strategically locate AI in their organizational structure, as well as its development.

In contrast to other cloud-based native services, ML and AI platforms on the cloud have various delivery models, such as speech reorganization, video analytics, other forms of cognitive computing, ML automation, ML model management, ML model serving, and GPU-based computing.


## Understanding how to use Cloud Machine Learning Engine


Cloud Machine Learning Engine is a Google Cloud-managed service that allows developers and information researchers to construct, operate, and produce better models for ML. Cloud ML Engine (or AI Platform) provides training and prediction services that can be used separately or together. Training and prediction services are now called AI Platform Training and AI Platform Prediction within ML Engine. The following diagram represents the Google Cloud AI Platform:

### Google Cloud AI Platform Notebooks

AI Platform Notebooks is a managed service that offers an embedded JupyterLab environment in which designers and information researchers can build JupyterLab cases with one single click of the recent information studies and ML frames. BigQuery, Cloud Dataproc, and Cloud Dataflow are integrated within the notebooks. This makes processing and preprocessing information simple to implement. This ultimately leads to modeling, training, and implementation simple in terms of information intake to exploration.

New JupyterLab cases can be deployed with one click and your information can be analyzed instantly. Every example is pre-configured with optimized variants of the most common data science and ML libraries. The JupyterLab interface utilizes Notebooks and is pre-installed with optimized library variants, such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, sci-kit-learn, pandas, SciPy, and Matplotlib. By adding CPU, RAM, and GPU, you can start small and then scale. If your information is too large for one computer, seamlessly move to services such as BigQuery, Cloud Dataproc, Cloud Dataflow, and AI Platform prediction training.
