# Building a Big Data Cloud Machine Learning Engine

Machine learning (ML) has revolutionized technology realms through the implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI). In the fields of customer support, fraud detection, and business intelligence, ML have continuously become the favorites of enterprises.

The importance of ML is influencing the cloud computing sector as well. Therefore, every cloud provider, including Google, is playing a large role in revolutionizing AI services on their platforms.

They have invested heavily in the past years, from the development of new services through major reorganizations that strategically locate AI in their organizational structure, as well as its development.

In contrast to other cloud-based native services, ML and AI platforms on the cloud have various delivery models, such as speech reorganization, video analytics, other forms of cognitive computing, ML automation, ML model management, ML model serving, and GPU-based computing.
