# Smart Conversational Applications Using DialogFlow

Artificial intelligence (AI) is continuously changing the way we search for and do stuff, and chatbots are the true illustration of people's desire to get rid of things that they do not want to do by themselves. AI-powered chatbots can do amazing things without involving humans.

A chatbot is a smart chat program. It should be able to convincingly simulate a person. When it is combined with AI technologies, it is called an intelligent chatbot. The most common instance of a chatbot is the client support system that some companies use. It has developed so that 70â€“80% of the conversation is conducted without an actual person from the company engaging the customer in conversation.

The banking and financial market is already making significant use of chatbots to deal with client requests and rapidly assist them in their bank transactions. For precisely the same reason, chatbot platforms are being provided by cloud providers to reduce time to market.

In this article, we will learn how to build conversational applications using a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) service named DialogFlow. DialogFlow provides an easy way for building conversational applications for businesses and can greatly save operational costs.
