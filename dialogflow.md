# Smart Conversational Applications Using DialogFlow

Artificial intelligence (AI) is continuously changing the way we search for and do stuff, and chatbots are the true illustration of people's desire to get rid of things that they do not want to do by themselves. AI-powered chatbots can do amazing things without involving humans.

A chatbot is a smart chat program. It should be able to convincingly simulate a person. When it is combined with AI technologies, it is called an intelligent chatbot. The most common instance of a chatbot is the client support system that some companies use. It has developed so that 70â€“80% of the conversation is conducted without an actual person from the company engaging the customer in conversation.

The banking and financial market is already making significant use of chatbots to deal with client requests and rapidly assist them in their bank transactions. For precisely the same reason, chatbot platforms are being provided by cloud providers to reduce time to market.

In this article, we will learn how to build conversational applications using a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) service named DialogFlow. DialogFlow provides an easy way for building conversational applications for businesses and can greatly save operational costs.


## Introduction to DialogFlow

Before we start with DialogFlow, we need to understand at a high level how different technologies are used to empower an intelligent chatbot system. Most chatbots are a kind of interface for emails or dialog where bots respond to your text instead of people. These chatbots operate within the context of the containing application.

However, the catch centers around the user interface layer that you communicate with. The conversations that humans have with bots is driven by machine learning (ML) algorithms that break your messages down into natural human language with natural language understanding (NLU) methods and answer queries in a manner that is comparable to what any human, on the other side, can expect.

### Understanding the building blocks of DialogFlow

Let's learn about the various building blocks of a conversational application by looking at the high-level architecture of DialogFlow. The following diagram represents the different components of any chatbot application at a high level:
