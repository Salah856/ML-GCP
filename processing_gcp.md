# Computing and Processing Using GCP Components


### Understanding the compute options

GCP provides various compute options to deploy your application and to use the actual Google infrastructure to run your applications.

The options available are as follows:

- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
- Containers
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)


All compute options communicate with other GCP services and products, like storage, networking, Stackdriver, security, and the big data product suite. Based on a given application's need, an appropriate compute option is selected from the Compute Engine, Kubernetes Engine, App Engine, and Cloud Functions.

Google compute options help you to run virtual machines of multiple sizes on Google infrastructure and to customize them. It enables you to run containerized applications, and you can directly deploy your code on the engines if you don't have to take care of infrastructure-related items. So based on your needs, Google provides multiple options to use compute power, expedite the development effort, and reduce the time to market.
